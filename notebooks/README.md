## Project Description

This project focuses on analyzing user traffic and behavior patterns from network data. The goal is to extract actionable insights that can help improve user experience, optimize service delivery, and inform business decisions. The analysis is based on a dataset that contains user session details, including traffic volume, session duration, and the applications used during the sessions.
Project Goals:

    Identify Key Traffic Trends: Understand how users engage with different applications and the overall traffic patterns across multiple sessions.
    Segmentation of User Behavior: Use clustering techniques to categorize users based on their traffic behavior and session characteristics.
    Application Contribution Analysis: Analyze how various applications contribute to the total network traffic and user engagement.

# Approach:

    Data Preprocessing:
        Clean and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure that data is in a usable format.
        Create new columns to categorize traffic based on application types (e.g., Social Media, Google, Email, YouTube).

    Univariate and Bivariate Analysis:
        Conduct univariate analysis to explore individual variables like session duration, total upload/download traffic, and their distributions.
        Perform bivariate analysis to investigate relationships between different variables, such as how session duration correlates with data usage.

    Clustering:
        Apply clustering techniques like K-Means to segment users into groups based on their traffic patterns.
        Use methods like the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters and analyze the distribution of users within these clusters.

    Application Analysis:
        Categorize the traffic into different application types and analyze their contributions to total traffic.
        Assess how different user groups (based on clustering) engage with specific applications and their respective traffic usage.

# Key Insights:

    Top Applications: Social Media, Google, and YouTube emerge as the most heavily used applications, accounting for the largest portion of the network traffic.
    User Segmentation: Through clustering, users are categorized into distinct groups with differing usage patterns, which could be useful for personalized services or targeted marketing.
    Traffic Distribution: A large variance exists in how different applications contribute to total traffic, providing opportunities to optimize network resources or offer differentiated services.

# Future Directions:

    Further analysis of temporal patterns, such as peak usage times or day-of-week traffic variations, to identify additional optimization opportunities.
    Study the impact of specific user demographics or behaviors on their traffic patterns for more targeted service offerings.

This project combines exploratory data analysis, clustering techniques, and application-specific insights to provide a deeper understanding of user behavior in network traffic, offering valuable information for both technical optimization and business decision-making.
